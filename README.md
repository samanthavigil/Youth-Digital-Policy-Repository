Welcome to the Youth Digital Policy Repository! 

What does this project do?
This is an in-progress tool for tracking social media legislation aimed at those 18 and under. Legislation has been collected globally from legislative sessions beginning in  2022 and is ongoing. Once published, the tool will be open-source for others to recommend policies to add and be formally updated by our team bi-annually. 

Why is this project useful?
The Youth Digital Policy Repository (YDPR) allows scholars who study social media legislation for minors to easily keep tabs on the busy, ever-evolving legislative landscape. For those who study child and adolescent social media use more broadly, the tool allows for insight into important areas of research, helping to bridge the academic and public sectors. 

How do I use and cite this project? 
Updated information on using and citing the YDPR in your work will be made available as soon as the project is officially published. Please check back for updates and reach out with any questions!
